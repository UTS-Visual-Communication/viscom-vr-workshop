            <h1>Introduction to <br/>VR Task</h1>
			<h2>For This Task</h2>
			<p>This brief aims to be a basic introduction to designing for virtual environments and a how we can use a “code library” - A-Frame - to use the basic web skills we already have to create a simple virtual reality experience.</p> 

<p>You will design a simple virtual reality experience that lives on the web, based on the idea of a traditional model of the solar system. This is only a place to start and you can play and run with it as you wish.</p>

<p>The following outlines the process, although your studio leaders will also run you through the process in class.</p>

            
			<h2>Requirements / How to do This Task</h2>
			<p>We will be giving you a base file to work on that includes the 'Rhythm' essay. Stick to the base code, and using what we teach you in class we want you design the details of the page</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Use CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) to alter the typography of the layout. You should seek to create a visual hierarchy in the typography (i.e. using the typographic detailing and white space)</li>
				<li>Design two images that illustrate or visualise two ideas in the text. Include these images in your web page.</li>
                <li>You can use the generic web fonts (i.e. ariel, times, verdana). But you should also aim to use web fonts. As they are free and accessible we will be using Google Web Fonts in class and recommend you stick to them for your assignment (for now!)</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Working on Your Design</h2>
            <p>You can work directly with the code in order to achieve your design. Sometimes however it can be quicker to sketch out on paper what you are imagining it will look like. You can use thumbnail sketches to quickly detail the layout and visual hierarchy of your page.</p>

				<p>If you would like to learn more in your own time there are many excellent books and online tutorials that you can extend your new web knowledge with, visit <a href="http://www.dontfeartheinternet.com/">Don't Fear the Internet</a>. This is a series of short video tutorials by designers.</p>
            <h2>Reading</h2>
            <p><a href="http://blog.froont.com/brief-history-of-web-design-for-designers/">A brief history of web design for designers.</a> What is possible for designers online is tightly linked with technology. In this brief historical account we see the evolution of the material, and design possibilites of the web.</p>
            <br/>
           
                
            <p>*Consider how these images work with your choices as regards to your typography. How do the text and image stylistically work together in terms of their visual qualities? Do they use the same palette? Or are images of a constrasing pallete to distinguish them from the type?</p>
