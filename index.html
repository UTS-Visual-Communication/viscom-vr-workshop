            <h1>Introduction to <br/>VR Task</h1>
			<!-- --------------------------------------------------------- -->
			<h2>For This Task</h2>
			<p>This brief aims to be a basic introduction to designing for virtual environments and a how we can use a “code library” - A-Frame - to use the basic web skills we already have to create a simple virtual reality experience.</p>

<p>You will design a simple virtual reality experience that lives on the web, based on the idea of a traditional model of the solar system. This is only a place to start and you can play and run with it as you wish.</p>

      <!-- --------------------------------------------------------- -->
			<h2>Groups</h2>
			<p>Get into groups of 2 to 3, try and form groups with at least one person who felt confident with the web (HTML) components of the course earlier this semester.</p>

			<!-- --------------------------------------------------------- -->
			<h2>Brief & Deliverables</h2>
			<p>Enjoy playing with the possibilities of designing and creating for virtual environments. Document your process for your folio and in your own time write a reflection that responds to following provocation: XXXX</p>

			<!-- --------------------------------------------------------- -->
			<h2>Glitch</h2>
			<p>We will be using the Glitch platform to develop your project. In order to access your project and continue working on it after class you need to make an account, which you can do by either logging in with Github or facebook. You can choose either of these options, though making a github account now is a good idea if you think you will be working with code any time in the future. The following instructions assume you will be taking the github path, though feel free to log in with facebook if you so choose. I don’t recommend tying online services to your facebook account, this is up to you and it will work the same as using github.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Make an account at <a href="http://github.com">http://github.com</a></li>
				<li>If you are interested check out the ‘education pack’ offered by github (though this is not needed for our workshop) <a href="https://education.github.com/pack">https://education.github.com/pack</a></li>
				<li>Go to <a href="http://glitch.com">http://glitch.com</a> and login using your github credentials.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Glitch is a quick and easy way to develop web content without having to worry about servers or code editors. It’s everything in one place without any setup. </p>

			<!-- --------------------------------------------------------- -->
			<h2>Inspiration</h2>
			<p>In our brief introduction to creating for VR we will make a virtual Orrery. Check out these links for some inspiration. (We will have looked at these in the lecture already, but just as a reminder)</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://www.google.com.au/search?q=Orrery&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwik_pK0q6zaAhWHULwKHRVzDtsQ_AUICigB&biw=1673&bih=964">a google image search of Orrery images</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5I-R7ZM3sU">Scene from The Dark Crystal (1982)</a></li>
			</ul>

			<!-- --------------------------------------------------------- -->
			<h2>Process</h2>
			<p>The following outlines the process, although your studio leaders will also run you through the process in class.</p>

			<!-- --------------------------------------------------------- -->
			<h2>A-Frame VR</h2>
			<p><a href="http://aframe.io">http://aframe.io</a></p>
			<p>We will be using AFrame, a javascript library for creating web based VR experiences. You will have heard me speak about this in the lecture, but your studio leaders will also run through some of the basics with you, more than enough to get you up and running to create your first VR experience.</p>
			<p>This is a very powerful library that offers a lot of flexibility and allows you to write complex interactions using javascript, though today we will be looking at working exclusively with HTML elements. (Next year in Narrative, Form and Time you will learn to write interactive code using P5.js - the javascript library you looked at in first semester)</p>

			<h2>Basic Example - “VR-Starter” play</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Have a look at this link. <a href="https://viscom-vr.glitch.me/basic.html">https://viscom-vr.glitch.me/basic.html</a> </li>
				<li>Open it in your desktop browser - click and drag around in the browser window, use the arrow keys to move around.</li>
				<li>Open the same link <a href="https://viscom-vr.glitch.me/basic.html">https://viscom-vr.glitch.me/basic.html</a> on your smartphone. Hold the phone horizontally and look around.</li>
				<li>Get your cardboard viewer ready, tap the “goggles” icon on this site and when the view splits into two, pop it into the viewer and have a look. You can press the button on the viewer to move forward in the direction you are facing.</li>
			</ul>

			<!-- --------------------------------------------------------- -->
			<h2>Basic Example - “VR-Starter” code </h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Have a look at this link on your desktop computer. <a href="https://glitch.com/edit/#!/viscom-vr?path=index.html:1:0">https://glitch.com/edit/#!/viscom-vr?path=index.html:1:0</a></li>
				<li>This has the code in a Glitch project for the VR starter world you just looked at.</li>
				<li>Think about the elements you are familiar with from the web components this semester.</li>
				<li>Your studio leaders will walk you through the code and what each line does. The comments are also there to explain what everything does</li>
			</ul>

			<!-- --------------------------------------------------------- -->
			<h2>Remix your own VR project</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Now is the time to start experimenting!</li>
				<li>You will need to make your own version of the project on Glitch, by using Glitch's "remix" funtion.</li>
				<li>To do this make sure you are on this page <a href="https://glitch.com/~viscom-vr">https://glitch.com/~viscom-vr</a>  and click the "Remix Your Own" button found below the project preview window.</li>
				<li>This will create a new project for you to work in. (Make sure you were logged into Glitch either via Github or Facebook)</li>
				<li>You will want to work with the "index.html" file (at least initially)</li>
				<li>Use the comments to guide you, change parameters and add extra objects, then move onto making the project your own, byt devising a look and feel for your project by uploading your own assets to glitch and using these in your project as textures</li>
				<li>Use the diagram below to help visualise the way the "heirachy" of elements in the scene works</li>
				IMAGE
				<li><strong>Remeber to keep trying your project out on your mobile device in the cardboard headset</strong></li>
			</ul>


			<!-- --------------------------------------------------------- -->
			<h2>Adding your own assets to the glitch project</h2>
			<p>To add images you will use as textures via glitch, you need to use the Glitch assets system</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Within the Glitch editor for your project, click the "assets" button in the left hand column.</li>
				<li>When this opens you will see some assets we have provided for you to experiment with. To use one of these click the image, then the "copy URL" button and use the URL directly ion your code. (ie: in the "A-Assets" section of your index.html code)</li>
				<li>To add your own image (.jpg or .png) click the "Add Asset" dropdown button in the top left of the panel ands follow the imntructions. Then use this in the same way by getting its URL using the "copy URL" button.</li>
				<li>Remebner to check out the comments in the example "index.html" file for more info on the way you use images in A-Frame	</li>
			</ul>

			<!-- --------------------------------------------------------- -->
			<h2>Links to helpful A-Frame documentation</h2>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://aframe.io/docs/0.8.0/introduction/">A-Frame "getting started" page</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://aframe.io/docs/0.8.0/introduction/html-and-primitives.html">Introductions to the the basics of writing HTML for A-Frame</a> **This is a really helpful page to read through and understand**</li>
				<li><a href="https://aframe.io/docs/0.8.0/primitives/a-box.html">"A-Box" documentation.</a> See also all of the other primitive types you can make. Their documentation is in the left hand column of the same webpage. These include a-circle, a-cone, a-cyliner, a-dodecahedron, a-icosahedron, a-octahedron, a-plane, a-ring, a-sphere, a-tetrahedron, a-torusknot, a-torus, a-text</li>
				<li><a href="https://aframe.io/docs/0.8.0/core/animations.html">An explanation of the animation system</a></li>
